# Datagrid
Red Hat Data Grid increases application response times and allows developers to dramatically improve performance while providing availability, reliability, and elastic scale. <br/>
It's based on the Infinispan upstream project.
The templates install the Infinispan [operator](https://infinispan.org/docs/infinispan-operator/main/operator.html) in the **bobbycar** namespace.
